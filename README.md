This site is being built so that we can get hands on experience with backend systems and produce a product that pulls from multiple databases and updates the information pulled regularly.

## Getting Started

Location-route
step 1: Copy base code from our Repo.
step 2: In terminal window 'npm install dotenv' and create '.env' file containing PORT='port number you use'.

step 4: deploy if desired.
