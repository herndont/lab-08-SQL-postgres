Overview
This site is being built so that we can get hands on experience with backend systems and produce a product that pulls from multiple databases and updates the information pulled regularly.

Getting Started
Location-route step 1: Copy base code from our Repo. step 2: In terminal window 'npm install dotenv' and create '.env' file containing PORT='port number you use'. step 3: Run nodemon and test routes (location) and outputs. step 4: deploy if desired.

Architecture
Langauges currently in use include, JavaScript, node, JSON, npm, SQL. NPM packages in use: express, cors, dotenv, superagent

Change Log
2019-03-19 12:20 - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the /location resource. 2019-03-20 12:20 - Application has a /weather GET route and a /meetups GET route, and an error handler.

Credits and Collaborations
Credit should be given to CodeFellows for providing all of the frontend javascript, html, and CSS. CodeFellows also gave guidance on the creation of the backend portion.
